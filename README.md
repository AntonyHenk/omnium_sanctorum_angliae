# omnium_sanctorum_angliae
A wiki for all the saints known to have been venerated in Early England 

This repository currently only exists to store the wiki (though the data in the wiki will eventually move into a database site like PASE). The purpose of the wiki is to aid me in identifying saints' relics in relic lists and keeping the feast dates, saint names, hagiographical traits, etc. organised for all the saints I deal with. I just don't want to have to code a wiki from the ground up.
